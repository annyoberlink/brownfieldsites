      Cleaner Soil: Who Pays the Price?</h1>
    <p>By Anny Oberlink</p>

  <p>Brownfields, as designated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),
          are sites that have the presence of pollutants or contaminants that require remediation before redevelopment,
          expansion, or reuse. Brownfields can contain heavy metals or organic solvents from past industrial land use.
           If left untreated, the contaminants can lead to heightened public exposure.</p>

    </p>
    <p>New York City has more than 7,000 properties designated as brownfields. In 2007, the city launched the first municipal brownfield cleanup initiative in the country, <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/oer/remediation/voluntary-cleanup.page" target="new">the Voluntary Cleanup Program (VCP)</a>, which allows private developers to remediate brownfields using private funds and grants from the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      A recent impact study published by the <a href="https://furmancenter.org/files/Analysis_of_NYC_Voluntary_Cleanup_Program.pdf">NYU Furman Center</a> found that VCP sites are concentrated in certain neighborhoods that have experienced redevelopment over the years, and may be part of a larger trend. Neighborhoods with VCP sites have also experienced an increase in median household income in the past ten years, compared to other neighborhoods. However, the report does not draw a conclusive relationship between redevelopment rates and VCP sites:

  “The cleanup of contaminated sites is important for the health, safety, and vitality of communities,” said Luis Inaraja Vera, a legal fellow at NYU Furman Center.  “While more work is needed to understand the effect that the city’s VCP is having on redevelopment rates in the city, our research shows that the program does a good job attracting owners to participate, which is one important measure of a program’s success.”
